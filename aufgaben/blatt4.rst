Aufgabe 1 - Proxies
-------------------

Implement a logging proxy object. Its constructor takes an arbitrary
object. The proxy is supposed to keep a list of all attribute that were
accessed on the object, including special methods, in order of access.
The log can be accessed using a global function ``get_proxy_log``. The
test functions are given in ``aufgaben/blatt3.py``.

In addition, write another test function with a proxy around a
dictionary, testing at least the special methods ``__getitem__`` and
``__setitem__``.

Ideally, your source code should not define all ``__xxx__`` methods by
copy-pasting them in the source of the class, but by putting these
methods inside the class programmatically (with a loop).



Aufgabe 2 - Prototypes
----------------------

The point of this exercise is to explore a different approach to object-oriented
programming, called prototype-based programming. In prototype-based programming
there is no distinction at all between classes and objects. The task of this
exercise is to implemented a class ``ProtoObject`` in Python whose instances
behave like prototype-objects. This behaviour includes:

 - Every prototype-object has a number of attributes. Among those attributes
   there is a special attribute called ``parent`` which must be another
   prototype-object or ``None``.

 - When trying to read an attribute from a prototype-object, first the
   attributes of the object itself are checked, then the attributes of the
   ``parent`` object, and so on.

 - When reading an attribute, and that attribute's value has a ``__get__``
   method, that method should be called to get proper binding behaviour.

 - Writing an attribute works different from Python: When writing an attribute
   the ``parent`` chain is searched for a place where the attribute already
   exists. The new value is put into this prototype-object. When the attribute
   exists nowhere yet, it is put into the original object.

 - If the ``parent`` attribute is not specified, it is set to a base
   prototype-object called ``default_parent``.

 - The ``default_parent`` object has just one attribute, a method ``clone`` that
   can be used to make a copy of a prototype-object.


In addition to ``ProtoObject`` implement a metaclass ``ProtoMeta`` that can be
used to build prototype-objects using the class-syntax. ProtoMeta needs to
implement ``__call__`` and ``__call__`` should return a new instance of
``ProtoObject``.

The file ``blatt4.py`` contains a number of tests for prototype-objects. If you
hit under-specified behaviour during the implementation, decide on a sensible
behaviour and write a test for it.


Aufgabe 3 - Lua tables
----------------------

The Lua programming language has a single data structure called *table*
instead of Python's *list* and *dict*.  A table is a dictionary-like
structure that can also behave like a list when the keys are integers.

The purpose of this exercice is to design, test and implement a simple
``Table`` class in Python.  It should have a dictionary-like interface,
supporting at least expressions like:

* ``table[key] = value``

* ``value = table[key]``

* ``key in table`` (test for existence of a key; this calls the
  ``__contains__`` special method on the table)

It should also support list-like expressions like:

* ``len(table)``, which should return the smallest integer ``n`` such
  that ``n not in table``.  For example, if the table contains the keys
  0, 1 and 2, then its length should be 3.  If the table also contains
  other keys like 42 and "hello world", then they are ignored the length
  is 3 anyway.  If the table doesn't even contain the key 0, its length
  is 0.

* ``table.append(x)``, equivalent to ``table[len(table)] = x``.

* ``del table[index]`` and ``table.insert(index, x)`` should work like
  in lists: they should remove or insert an element in the middle of
  the list, shifting the end of the list.  For example, if the table
  contains ``{0: 'x', 1: 'y'}``, then after ``del table[0]`` it
  should contain ``{0: 'y'}``.

* ``table1 + table2`` should work like list concatenation if the tables
  just contain consecutive 0-based numbers as keys.  For the cases of
  tables that also contain more keys, design a "sensible" way to put
  them in the result.

Write tests *first!*
