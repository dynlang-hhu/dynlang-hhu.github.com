Multiple Inheritance
======================

Multiple Inheritance
======================

- single inheritance has limits
- sometimes it would be good to say an object is one of several things
- solution: multiple inheritance

Changes
=====================

- every class inherits from n classes
- lookup mechanism needs to look in all bases/parents
- more careful algorithm needed!

Simple Use Cases
=================

- interfaces
- mixins (base classes without state)
 

Superclass Linearization
========================

- also known as *class precedence list* or *method resolution order* (mro)
- how to do lookup?
- for every class, create a list that describes in which order method lookup is performed
- interesting criteria:

   - acceptability
   - observation of local precedence order
   - monotonicity

Acceptability
=======================

only take the bit of the class hierarchy starting from the class for which to compute the mro into account

in other words: mro must be a local property


Observation of Local Precedence Order
=====================================

the baseclasses of a class must appear in the right order in its mro

Monotonicity
=============

the elements of an mro of a base class must be in the same order in the mro of a subclass


How to compute the linearization
================================

 * compute mro from mro of bases
 * *merge* those mros to ensure monotonicity and local precedence order
