What is an Object?
==================

An object consist of two elements:

- State + Behaviour


Why Object-Orientation?
=======================

**Abstraction**

To use an object, we don't need to know how it is implemented.

Object-Orientation in Dynamic Languages
=======================================

Two important principles for OO in dynamic languages:

- Everything is an object
- Every object is an instance of a class (a type)

Messages
========

- Objects interact by sending messages to each other
- The implementation of a message is called a method
- message send consists of two steps: *lookup* and *call*
- lookup finds which method to use, call calls it
- lookup happens fully at runtime!



Python: Instance-Attributes
===========================

- Instance-attributes are the state part of an object
- they are stored in a dictionary attached to the instance

Python: Object Creation
=======================

- instances are created by calling a type
- classes are normal instances of type ``type``
