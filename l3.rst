Python's Attributes
===================

Reminder
============

a message send consists of two steps:

- lookup the message implementation
- activate (i.e. call) the method that was found in this way

those are done in one step, not visible to the programmer


Attributes
============

in Python, those steps are separated in the language::

    obj.method(argument_1, ..., argument_n)

is identical to::

    m = obj.method
    m(argument_1, ..., argument_n)

Bound methods
==============

- The object ``m`` is called a *bound method*
- it can be called like a function
- it is bound to the object out of which it was read
- thus reading methods out of objects behave like object-attributes
